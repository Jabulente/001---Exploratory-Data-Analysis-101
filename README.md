# U.S. Presidents Heights: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview

This project explores the heights of U.S. presidents using Python. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we examine trends, distributions, and statistical insights related to presidential heights over time. The analysis includes visualizations, summary statistics, and potential correlations with historical factors.


---

## Dataset

The dataset contains height measurements of U.S. presidents along with relevant metadata. It typically includes the following columns:

President â€“ Name of the U.S. president

Height (cm) â€“ Height of the president in inches

Year of Birth â€“ Birth year of the president

Presidential Order â€“ The chronological order in which the president served.


---

## Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis on the heights of U.S. presidents.

- Visualize height distributions and trends over time.

- Identify potential patterns or correlations between height and historical periods.

- Provide statistical insights and summary metrics.

## Technologies Used

**Python**

**Pandas**: (for data manipulation)

**Matplotlib & Seaborn**: (for visualization)

**NumPy**: (for numerical computations)

## Exploratory Data Analysis Steps

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**

- Load dataset using Pandas

- Check for missing values and inconsistencies



## 2. Summary Statistics

- Calculate mean, median, mode, and standard deviation

- Determine the tallest and shortest presidents



# 3. Data Visualization

- Histogram and KDE plot for height distribution

- Line plot to visualize height trends over time



# 4. Correlation Analysis

- Investigate potential relationships between height and historical time periods





---

# Key Findings

- The average height of U.S. presidents is approximately 5 feet 10 inches.

- The tallest president is Abraham Lincoln (6 feet 4 inches), while the shortest is James Madison (5 feet 4 inches).

- Over time, there has been a trend toward taller presidents.
